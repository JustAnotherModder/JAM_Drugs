# JAM_Drugs

- So I heard you like Gangwars?
- Drug sales to bulk buyers and individual NPCs. Drug purchases from armed labs. Safe cracking at armed labs (if you have the fire power to take it over, more guards spawn with more firepower). Chance of attempt at robbery from drug buyers. Chance of snitching from drug sellers. Carrying more heat (weapons or drugs) effects the chances of these things. More profit gained from dealing in only dirty money, encouraging players to play an active criminal character instead of "stand in a circle for slow but fast money". Plus worker NPCs just for looks (plus the asian ladies try to stab you if you fuck around).

# NOTES

- Incomplete. Don't use.
- Soon to be part of a much larger criminal framework.
- Probably won't even integrate if you don't know what you're doing. Also need:
